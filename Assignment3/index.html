                             "Peafowl is a common name for two bird species in the genera Pavo and Afropavo within the
                             tribe Pavonini of the family Phasianidae (the pheasants and their allies). Male peafowl
                             are referred to as peacocks, and female peafowl are referred to as peahens, although
                             peafowl of either sex are often referred to colloquially as "peacocks"."</p>

                                "The two Asiatic species are the blue or Indian peafowl originally from the Indian
                                subcontinent, and the green peafowl from Southeast Asia; The Congo peafowl is not a true
                                peafowl, native only to the Congo Basin. Male peafowl are known for their piercing calls
                                and their extravagant plumage. The latter is especially prominent in the Asiatic
                                species, which have an eye-spotted "tail" or "train" of covert feathers, which they
                                display as part of a courtship ritual."</p>

                                "The functions of the elaborate iridescent colouration and large "train" of peacocks have
                                been the subject of extensive scientific debate. Charles Darwin suggested that they
                                served to attract females, and the showy features of the males had evolved by sexual
                                selection. More recently, Amotz Zahavi proposed in his handicap principle that these
                                features acted as honest signals of the males' fitness, since less-fit males would be
                                disadvantaged by the difficulty of surviving with such large and conspicuous structures."

                                <P>The Indian peacock (Pavo cristatus) has iridescent blue and green plumage, mostly
                                    metal-like blue and green. In both species, females are a little smaller than males
                                    in terms of weight and wingspan, but males are significantly longer due to the
                                    "tail", also known as a "train".[2] The peacock train consists not of tail quill
                                    feathers, but highly elongated upper tail coverts. These feathers are marked with
                                    eyespots, best seen when a peacock fans his tail. All species have a crest atop the
                                    head. The Indian peahen has a mixture of dull grey, brown, and green in her plumage.
                                    The female also displays her plumage to ward off female competition or signal danger
                                    to her young.</P>

                                    wings with a sheen of blue. Unlike Indian peafowl, the green peahen is similar to
                                    the male, but has shorter upper tail coverts, a more coppery neck, and overall less
                                    iridescence. Both males and females have spurs.[3]"</p>

                                    "The Congo peacock (Afropavo congensis) male does not display his covert feathers, but
                                    uses his actual tail feathers during courtship displays. These feathers are much
                                    shorter than those of the Indian and green species, and the ocelli are much less
                                    pronounced. Females of the Indian and African species are dull grey and/or brown.
                                    Chicks of both sexes in all the species are cryptically coloured. They vary between
                                    yellow and tawny, usually with patches of darker brown or light tan and "dirty
                                    white" ivory.
                                    Mature peahens have been recorded as suddenly growing typically male peacock plumage
                                    and making male calls.[4] Research has suggested that changes in mature birds are
                                    due to a lack of estrogen from old or damaged ovaries, and that male plumage and
                                    calls are the default unless hormonally suppressed.[5]"</p>

                                    "As with many birds, vibrant iridescent plumage colours are not primarily pigments,
                                    but structural colouration. Optical interference Bragg reflections, based on
                                    regular, periodic nanostructures of the barbules (fiber-like components) of the
                                    feathers, produce the peacock's colours. 2D photonic-crystal structures within the
                                    layers of the barbules cause the colouration of their feathers.[6] Slight changes to
                                    the spacing of the barbules result in different colours. Brown feathers are a
                                    mixture of red and blue: one colour is created by the periodic structure and the
                                    other is created by a Fabry-Pérot interference peak from reflections from the outer
                                    and inner boundaries. Color derived from physical structure rather than pigment can
                                    vary with viewing angle, causing iridescence.[7]"</p>

                                    directly in front of the male peacock – thus providing her the ability to assess the
                                    male at 90° to the surface of the feather. Then, the male will turn and display his
                                    feathers about 45° to the right of the sun's azimuth which allows the sunlight to
                                    accentuate the iridescence of his train. If the female chooses to interact with the
                                    male, he will then turn to face her and shiver his train so as to begin the mating

                in Relation to Sex that peafowl plumage may have evolved through
                sexual selection: Many female progenitors of the peacock must, during a long line of
                descent, have appreciated this superiority; for they have unconsciously, by the

                                <p>As with many birds, vibrant iridescent plumage colours are not primarily pigments,
                                    but structural colouration. Optical interference Bragg reflections, based on
                                    regular, periodic nanostructures of the barbules (fiber-like components) of the
                                    feathers, produce the peacock's colours. 2D photonic-crystal structures within the
                                    layers of the barbules cause the colouration of their feathers.[6] Slight changes to
                                    the spacing of the barbules result in different colours. Brown feathers are a
                                    mixture of red and blue: one colour is created by the periodic structure and the
                                    other is created by a Fabry–Pérot interference peak from reflections from the outer
                                    and inner boundaries. Color derived from physical structure rather than pigment can
                                    vary with viewing angle, causing iridescence.[7]</p>

                        <p>As with many birds, vibrant iridescent plumage colours are not primarily pigments, but
                            structural colouration. Optical interference Bragg reflections, based on regular, periodic
                            nanostructures of the barbules (fiber-like components) of the feathers, produce the
                            peacock's colours. 2D photonic-crystal structures within the layers of the barbules cause
                            the colouration of their feathers.[6] Slight changes to the spacing of the barbules result
                            in different colours. Brown feathers are a mixture of red and blue: one colour is created by
                            the periodic structure and the other is created by a Fabry–Pérot interference peak from
                            reflections from the outer and inner boundaries. Color derived from physical structure
                            rather than pigment can vary with viewing angle, causing iridescence.[7]</p>

                            the male at 90° to the surface of the feather. Then, the male will turn and
                            display his feathers about 45° to the right of the sun's azimuth which allows
                            the sunlight to accentuate the iridescence of his train. If the female chooses
                            to interact with the male, he will then turn to face her and shiver his train so
